Project Overview
The personalized healthcare system leverages machine learning to predict cardiovascular risks and provide tailored recommendations. It incorporates real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and dynamic adaptation to deliver personalized health management and improve patient outcomes.

System Overview
The system integrates multiple components:

An Integrated Predictive Health Dashboard for forecasting cardiovascular risks.
A Telemedicine Platform for continuous health monitoring and virtual consultations.
Personalized Dietary Plans for customized nutrition guidance.
Dynamic Exercise Adaptation for safe and effective fitness routines.
Each module uses data from wearable devices, historical records, and environmental factors for real-time, data-driven insights.
